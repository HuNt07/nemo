# Emo(An Interactive Emoticon)
## Problem Defination
### We are paying a sort of tribute to the emoji/emoticon which allows us to truly express in a modern converstion by building a interactive experience around it,the mouse and the keyboard.
## Setup
`sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev`-Run this command on your Linux terminal to install GLUT<br>
`gcc -o emo emo.c -lGL -lGLU -lGLUT -lm`-Run this command to compile Emo on your machine<br>
`./emo `-Run this to C the output
## The file emo.c is a little messy but it works just fine :))
## Keyboard Controls
|Key|Emotion| 
|----|------|
|S|Sad|
|H|Happy|
|B|Blush|
|C|Cry|
|N|Neutral|
## Eyes follow the Mouse Pointer they try.
